		<h1>Variable</h1>
		<p>A variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantitiy of information refferred to as a value; (a variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or types of data (like integer, float, string etc..))</p>
		<p>A variable can eventually be associated with or identified by a memory address.</p>
		<p>The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents.</p>
		<p>The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.</p>
		<p>A variable's storage location may be referenced by several different identifiers, a situation known as aliasing. Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.</p>
		<p>Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program exexution.</p>
