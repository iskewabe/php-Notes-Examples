Null

Has only one value:
    - null (case-insensitive)

=> Undefined, and unset() variables will resolve to the value null.

* Undefined variable is a variable without a value, since PHP is a dynamically typed language. In other words, it's a memory location with a default null value.

* unset() is a function that removes a value from a variable. This method will replace the value that existed in the memory with the null value.

<?php
$var = null;
?>

Methods that exist for use
